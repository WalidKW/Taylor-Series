# Taylor-Series
- implements the Taylor series expansion of the function (1+x) for any x in the interval (-1,1], as given by: <br />
(1+x)=x−x2/2+x3/3−x4/4+x5/5−....
- The program prompts the user to enter the number of terms n as well as the value of x, and then computes the approximation to (1 + x) using the first n terms of the preceding series. The program prints the approximate value.
